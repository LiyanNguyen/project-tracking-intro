### My Process
- Design the Desktop Viewport first, then the Mobile viewport
- Design the flex/grid system, making sure to have both Desktop and Mobile Viewport layout correct
- Make sure to hide the desktop navigation bar on mobile view
- Add in all the other HTML content
- Create the dropdown menu on mobile view using relative and absolute positioning
- Add in the JS script to open and close the menu on mobile viewport

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I Learned
- More Flexbox
- More Grid (life saver)
- More Background Images
- Always use vh/vw as a startig point, and use rem units on smaller things
